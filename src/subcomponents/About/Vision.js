            <p className="componentText"> The Center of Advancement in Sustainable Energy Technologies seeks to catalyze
            progress in the development of innovative and scalable technologies that will support
            the transition to the adoption of clean energy across the global landscape. The Center
            envisions delivering pioneering solutions to tackle challenges where energy will play
            an essential role in holistically advancing the pathway to a sustainable future in India
            and around the world. </p>

            <p className="componentTitle secondaryTitle"> Mission </p>
            <p className="componentText"> The Mission of the Center for Advancement in Sustainable Energy Technologies
            (CASET) is to foster a sustainable energy future by supporting research, education,
            innovation, collaboration, and entrepreneurship in advanced energy technologies. The
            Center is dedicated to developing and implementing affordable, cutting-edge solutions
            that will reduce carbon emissions, enhance energy security, and ensure equitable
            access to sustainable energy resources. Through a multidisciplinary approach, CASET
            will leverage the expertise of BITS Pilani faculty and engage external leaders from
            academia and industry to tackle complex energy challenges and drive transformative
            advancements in sustainable energy. </p>

            <p className="componentTitle secondaryTitle"> Objectives </p>
            <p className="componentText">1. To establish an inter-campus, interdisciplinary research and development team
            encompassing basic sciences, engineering, humanities, economics, and policy
            disciplines, leveraging BITS Pilani's unique position in interdisciplinary expertise to
            advance energy and environmental research.<br/><br/>
            2. To advance early-stage, science-driven proof-of-concept research at lower
            Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), enabling pathways for potential scale-up and
            implementation of developed technologies.<br/><br/>
            3. To develop industry-relevant solutions in energy and climate change by conducting
            applied research that addresses critical challenges in the industrial sector and
            ensure real-world impact through partnerships with industry stakeholders.<br/><br/>
            4. To support entrepreneurial initiatives by co-opting startup entrepreneurs, especially
            those originating from within BITS Pilani and including external entrepreneurs to
            foster innovation and commercialization of sustainable energy solutions.<br/><br/>
            5. To develop a specialized sub-center focused on the advancement of new and
            advanced materials for energy transition, equipped with state-of-the-art facilities for
            synthesis, testing and characterization within the existing campus infrastructure.<br/><br/>
            6. To prioritize skill development and capacity building by engaging graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral students, along with post-doctoral researchers, creating a
            pipeline of skilled experts in sustainable energy.<br/><br/>
            7. To integrate policy research and economic analysis through collaborations with
            economists, developing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and forecasting models, and
            leveraging expertise from mathematics, humanities, economics, and management
            disciplines to support sustainable energy policy development.<br/><br/>
            8. To facilitate international collaboration and outreach by building alliances with
            global bodies and engaging in initiatives that promote knowledge-sharing and
            sustainable energy practices on a global scale. </p>
