The technological integration will be embraced as part of holistic solution for converting waste biomass into resources such as transportation fuels, green chemicals and high value carbon for utilization into batteries and supercapacitors. With that, the Centre will act as a think tank for Government  biofuel policies via providing key insights based on technical, economical and environmental comparison of advanced processes. </p>
